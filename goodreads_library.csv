That’s sort of a low bar, though, because forced proximity is normally kinda creepy. This novel by Elena Armas tells the story of Rosie, an ex-engineer turned published romance author. After the roof of her apartment caves in, Rosie moves into her best friend Catalina’s apartment while she’s away on her honeymoon. Unfortunately, Catalina had promised her apartment to a cousin from Spain named Lucas, who Rosie had been online stalking for MONTHS, hoping they would meet at Catalina’s wedding. When he didn’t show up, her hopes of a meet-cute were dashed. This couple gets a re-do, however, cause being strapped for cash forces people to do crazy things, like sharing a studio apartment with a stranger. (The finances part is relatable. I’d share a place with a cute guy if it meant I wasn’t out thousands of $$$ while my place is being renovated.)<br/><br/>TARE was fun. I liked both of the main characters, which is pretty rare for romance. Lucas is sweet and flirty, the perfect opposite to Rosie’s Type A personality. It’s dual POV, though I think that Rosie gets quite a few more chapters, and I wish it was a little bit more equal. We hear a lot about Rosie’s family. Her brother is being distant, possibly getting into a bad situation, and her dad’s health is sort of on the decline. I never formed an emotional connection with either of these characters, so the family subplot wasn’t super interesting. It’s obviously just a mechanism for Rosie to be emotionally vulnerable in front of Lucas. And, even though I said that I like Rosie, her “ultra-responsible” persona got old quick. Without a mom, she grew up being the maternal presence in her family. I’m sure this is the reality for many women, but I like to read about women who subvert expectations. Since Lucas is sunshine, I thought Rosie was going to be grumpy—and she is, but not in an interesting way. I want to read about women who know what they want and take it. Let’s represent angry women in romance :)<br/><br/>Also, there are two scenes in which Rosie holds Lucas back from physical confrontation in her defense. I don’t like this. My biggest ick is when a brute force male jumps into a scene.<br/><br/>3.5 stars",,,1,0

59449896,"A Light in the Flame (Flesh and Fire, #2)",Jennifer L. Armentrout,"Armentrout, Jennifer L.",,,9781957568201,3,4.54,Blue Box Press,Hardcover,650,2022,2022,1/6/23,5/27/22,,,read,"“Gods, I wanted to hate how he curled his tongue around my name, making it sound like both a wicked whisper and a reverent prayer.”<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Before moving on to my review of A Light in the Flame, I’ll just say that I very much enjoyed this second installment in the Flesh and Fire series—but that didn’t stop me from getting fiercely irritated whenever I noticed editing problems. For example, the quote pulled from above is slightly over halfway through the novel, but in the very first chapter, the MC (Sera) thinks something VERY similar: “I could count on one hand how many people called me by my full name, and none of them spoke it like he did. As if it were a prayer and a reckoning.” Like, please, let’s not repeat ourselves. <br/><br/>Sera is just not the brightest MC. We’re reading from her POV, but it takes her forever to understand something that the readers have known for hundreds of pages. For example, Nyktos (the God of Death and her love interest) prevented himself from loving others not for his own benefit, but for the good of others. She realized long after he spelled it out for her, word for word, the reasons why he removed his kardia (the part of the soul that allows people to love). Girl. Also, when thinking about the God of Life’s court, Armentrout describes it as “a game where the rules were kept hidden.” But we were already aware of this comparison because just a couple chapters beforehand, the character Aios said that “his court is lawless and yet full of unknown rules that, if broken, result in death.” One other editing thing: at some point, Sera says that it had been so long since she’d seen the sun, but actually, she had visited the mortal realm just two days prior. ???<br/><br/>Thinking more structurally, this book is like a reread of Blood and Ash, with slightly different plot points. @MaePolzine does a great job at summarizing the similarities in her blog post, so I won’t repeat them. This didn’t necessarily bother me because it felt somewhat intentional, but I do think that Armentrout went a little far with it. <br/><br/>The dialogue was at times cringy and other times very funny. For some reason, modern slang is thrown in here, which sort of pulled me out of the reading experience. Sera says “you do you,” and Nektas says she’ll give off some Primal “vibes” if she drinks enough of Nyktos’s blood. (I won’t even explain Primal—if you’re still reading this, I’m assuming you’re familiar with the book.) Nyktos “growls” with displeasure, which is so animal-like, I kinda got the ick. <br/><br/>But there was definitely some great dialogue tucked in here too. The first scene by the pool was really funny. Sera says that it takes a lot to anger her, and Nyktos replies, “I want you to repeat what you just said and ask yourself it that’s the truth.” Also:<br/><br/>“I didn’t think I’d ever…”<br/>“See me again,” I finished, and she nodded. “Because I was supposed to kill this one?” I added, jerking my thumb at Nyktos.<br/>“Nice,” Nyktos remarked dryly under his breath.<br/><br/>I think Nyktos and Sera’s chemistry is good, which is obviously very important for fantasy romance. <br/><br/>3 stars!!",TRUE,,1,0

I love buying books about books, but I rarely finish them. I flew through this one!<br/><br/>Ellis’ book is a reflection on all the literary heroines who have played pivotal roles in her development, from her childhood to her early 30s. She revisits each of these heroines, determining whether they should still be admired and their influence maintained, now from an older POV. <br/><br/>The first couple of chapters were a little less interesting to me, just because they covered children’s books and the author’s early life. I appreciated chapter 4 onwards much more, as the life advice produced from reflecting on her college and adult life is more applicable to me personally. Even though I haven’t read most of the books discussed by Ellis, I still very much enjoyed her analysis. She gives sufficient summaries of each novel introduced, so I never felt left out in the cold. And for those heroines who I am acquainted with (Jane Eyre, the Little Mermaid), it was a lot of fun to get to know them a little better. <br/><br/>",,,1,0

I get intensely loyal to a character after reading from their perspective, so when Jason and Percy had a showdown in Kansas, I want Percy to kill that freaking blond all-american boy sooo bad.<br/><br/>Anyway, don’t enter this series with any expectations. The shifting perspectives I grew to like, but it was difficult in this book since the perspectives are so limited. We did not hear from Percy or Annabeth at all, my two favorite characters.<br/><br/>However loyal I may be, though, I must admit the newcomers were enjoyable. While I will forever dislike Jason, I appreciated that Rick gave him some glasses. That was a nice touch. It’s about time a hero doesn’t have perfect vision.<br/><br/>My favorite parts about this book were Nico and Reyna. It was so refreshing to be inside Nico’s head, understand a bit more about how this kid thinks. In the Percy Jackson series, I had no idea how he felt. We saw a new depth to him here. And REYNA was BADASS. I love how Rick weaves story lines from previous books into the Heroes of Olympus series. This girl rivals Annabeth in badassery. <br/><br/>I giggled A LOT throughout this book. As usual, the humor is perfect, and the references to the beloved quirks of our characters make me soo happy.<br/><br/>Lastly, Rick Riordan, I NEED a book centered on NICO. HOW EPICALLY ADORABLE AND FANTABULOUS WOULD THAT BE????",,,1,0

I loved the plot line, I loved Lia, I loved the romance. I don't know what more to say, other than go and READ IT. I bought as soon as it came out, and only read it now, right before the sequel came out, because I was so sure I was going to love it. And oh boy I did. <br/><br/>Lia was such a strong heroin. She had the sass that I respect in a character, she had humbleness that made her a likable princess, and she also had no vanity. That is something I especially appreciate; books these days focus too soon on the young woman's appearance rather than her wit. Lia was not an ice queen; she had hopes and dreams that may have seemed naive in the beginning but was perfectly understandable. <br/><br/>The romance; oh boy, did I mess this up in my brain. I was so sure that the prince was Kaden and the assassin was Rafe. Nothing deterred me otherwise until we got to the end, at which point I became entirely confused wondering if my copy had a typo. Pretty soon I realized my mistake, but my brain had already decided who was who, so the rest of the book had a difficult time setting up a situation with the person I later knew they were (did you get that?). Anyways it was a real punch to the gut, but I enjoyed it further because of the punch. <br/><br/>Overall this book was wonderful; I recommend it to all fantasy readers. Can't wait to read the sequel!",TRUE,,1,0
18478083,Kissing in America,Margo Rabb,"Rabb, Margo",,,9780062322371,2,3.52,Harper,Hardcover,400,2015,2015,7/4/15,6/14/15,,,read,"I stuck through this book because of my optimism that the plot would develop. It didn't. I went in to Kissing in America, with not much knowledge with what it was about. I only bought it because I saw it at a bargain price and knew that EpicReads was advertising for it on their website. <br/><br/>This books whole premise was of a young girl so desperate for a boy that she crosses America to see him again. While it may seem romantic, it wasn't. The whole story I just kept thinking of how stupid this girl was! And SPOILERS: Everyone knew she was not going to get the guy in the end. And yeah, it's not about the destination but the journey, yadah yadah yadah. But the journey was under developed also. This novel had the premise of a road trip, but it was completely unsatisfying. One third of the book wasn't even on the road! <br/><br/>The only thing that held me back from giving this book a one star, was the realistic writing on grief. I felt that Margo Rabb did a well done job on exploring the main character's feeling for her father. I also enjoyed the relationship of mother and daughter after he died. <br/><br/>Overall:<br/>If you're looking for a road trip novel, try Amy and Rodger's Epic Detour.<br/>If you're looking for a summer novel revolving around friendship, try Since You've Been Gone. <br/>If you're looking for a summer romance, look at any YA book other than this one.<br/><br/>But, if you're looking to read about a young girl struggling with a death in the family, and how she copes, go ahead and give Kissing in America a try.",,,1,0

I started it not so sure I would be able to finish it. I'm in 8th grade; not exactly the smartest person when it comes to science. However, Andy Weir wrote this novel in a way that made the story thrilling enough to be interested in the technological aspect of it all. Ok, I'm lying to myself a little. There were times when I look at all the chemical compounds and groaned. Maybe even checked when the humor would come along. And, my friend, that is the largest reason I stayed on the wagon, Mark's character. He was so funny! I found myself laughing at so many ironic things he said. So, if your thinking of not reading this book because it's too ""sciency"", read it anyway. I hate science. I loved this book. ",,,1,0
